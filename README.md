This repo contains a little experiment using Rust for rendering TMX-files in the bbrowser using WASM.

The most interesting part is probably the TMX-reader since it allows using Tiled to create maps.

If you stumble upon this and think my code sucks ... don't hesitate to comment since I am just learning Rust right now :)

A demo can be found [here](http://codepitbull.de/wasm/index.html), it takes quite a while to load :)
